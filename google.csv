who are in close contact with the infected person.[38 During human-to-human transmission an average 1000 infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection.[39][40]',b'The closer people interact and the longer they interact the more likely they are to transmit COVID-19 Closer distances can involve larger droplets (which fall to the ground and aerosols whereas longer distances only involve aerosols.[38 Larger droplets can also turn into aerosols (known as droplet nuclei through evaporation.[41 The relative importance of the larger droplets and the aerosols is not clear as of November 2020 however the virus is not known to spread between rooms over long distances such as through air ducts.[42 Airborne transmission is able to particularly occur indoors in high risk locations[42 such as restaurants choirs gyms nightclubs offices and religious venues often when they are crowded or less ventilated.[41 It also occurs in healthcare settings often when aerosol-generating medical procedures are performed on COVID-19 patients.[43]',b'Although it is considered possible there is no direct evidence of the virus being transmitted by skin to skin contact.[44 A person could get COVID-19 indirectly by touching a contaminated surface or object before touching their own mouth nose or eyes though this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.[44 The virus is not known to spread through feces urine breast milk food wastewater drinking water or via animal disease vectors (although some animals can contract the virus from humans) It very rarely transmits from mother to baby during pregnancy.[44]',b'Social distancing and the wearing of cloth face masks surgical masks respirators or other face coverings are controls for droplet transmission Transmission may be decreased indoors with well maintained heating and ventilation systems to maintain good air circulation and increase the use of outdoor air.[45]',"b'The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies.[44 Coronavirus disease 2019 is more infectious than influenza but less so than measles It often spreads in clusters where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location.[46 There is a major role of ""super-spreading events"" where many people are infected by one person.[44][47]'",b'A person who is infected can transmit the virus to others up to two days before they themselves show symptoms and even if symptoms never appear.[48 People remain infectious in moderate cases for 7\xe2\x80\x9312 days and up to two weeks in severe cases.[48 In October 2020 medical scientists reported evidence of reinfection in one person.[49][50]',b'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[51 All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[52]',b'Outside the human body the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts its protective bubble.[53]',b'SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[54 It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic origin Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B together with two bat-derived strains It is 96 identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[55][56 The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M) envelope protein (E) nucleocapsid protein (N) and the spike protein (S) The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98 similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV maintains around 98 homology with pangolin SARS-CoV and has 90 homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV whereas the similarity is only around 38 with the M protein of MERS-CoV The structure of the M protein resembles the sugar transporter SemiSWEET.[57]',b'The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into clades.[58 Several different clade nomenclatures have been proposed Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A 19B 20A 20B and 20C) while GISAID divides them into seven (L O V S G GH and GR).[59]',b'Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2020 Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign it is believed to have been eradicated The Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC 202012/01 is believed to have emerged in the United Kingdom in September The 501Y.V2 Variant which has the same N501Y mutation arose independently in South Africa.[60][61]',b'Three known variants of COVID-19 are currently spreading among global populations as of January 2021 including the UK Variant (referred to as B.1.1.7 first found in London and Kent a variant discovered in South Africa (referred to as 1.351) and a variant discovered in Brazil (referred to as P.1).[62]',b'Using Whole Genome Sequencing epidemiology and modelling suggest the new UK variant \xe2\x80\x98VUI 202012/01 (the first Variant Under Investigation in December 2020 transmits more easily than other strains.[63]',"b'COVID-19 can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses nose and throat and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[64 The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[65 The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a ""spike (peplomer to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.[66 The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,[67 though another view is that increasing ACE2 using angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective.[68 As the alveolar disease progresses respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.[69]'",b'Whether SARS-CoV-2 is able to invade the nervous system remains unknown The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 people with neurological issues However SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID-19 but these results need to be confirmed.[70 SARS-CoV-2 could cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the CNS While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[71][72][73 The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS possibly within an infected white blood cell.[70]',b'The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric duodenal and rectal epithelium[74 as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[75]',"b'The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[76 An acute cardiac injury was found in 12 of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan China,[77 and is more frequent in severe disease.[78 Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[76 ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.[76][79 A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found people transferred to Intensive care unit (ICU with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.[80 Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots are thought to play a significant role in mortality incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.[81 Furthermore microvascular blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brains without detected SARS-CoV-2 and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID-19.[82][83][84]'",b'Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[81 Early reports show that up to 30 of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[85]',b'Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.[86]',b'Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract people with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL-2 IL-7 IL-6 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) interferon- inducible protein 10 (IP-10) monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) macrophage inflammatory protein 1- (MIP-1\xce\xb1) and tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-\xce\xb1 indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS suggest an underlying immunopathology.[77]',b'Additionally people with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS have classical serum biomarkers of CRS including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) D-dimer and ferritin.[87]',b'Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart In particular pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID-19 .[88 Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.[86]',b'Multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus The S-protein otherwise known as the spike protein is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors It includes two subunits S1 and S2 S1 determines the virus host range and cellular tropism via the receptor binding domain S2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H1 and HR2 which are heptad repeat regions Studies have shown that S1 domain induced IgG and IgA antibody levels at a much higher capacity It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID-19 vaccines.[89]',"b""The M protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope.[90 The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response.[90]""",b'Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2 is the host factor that SARS-COV2 virus targets causing COVID-19 Theoretically the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID-19 though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB However no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes Until further data is available guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain.[91]',b'The virus effect on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration increased blood vessel permeability alveolar wall permeability as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms However the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.[92]',b'The severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm.[93 Levels of interleukin 1B interferon-gamma interferon-inducible protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease.[94]',b'A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID-19 it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality The storm causes the acute respiratory distress syndrome blood clotting events such as strokes myocardial infarction encephalitis acute kidney injury and vasculitis The production of IL-1 IL-2 IL-6 TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma all crucial components of normal immune responses inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm The cells of the central nervous system the microglia neurons and astrocytes are also be involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon.[95]',b'COVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.[96][97 Along with laboratory testing chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.[98 Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection.[96]',"b'The standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests,[96][99 which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[100 As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus its ""ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.""[101 The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab however a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[102][103 Results are generally available within hours.[96 The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.[104]'",b'A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.[105]',"b'The University of Oxford\'s CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence[106][107 that ""a good proportion of \'new mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with and have called for ""an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing""[108 On 7 September the UK government issued ""guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results.""[109]'",b'Chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.[98][110 Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection.[98][111 Subpleural dominance crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.[98][112 Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.[113]',b'Many groups have created COVID-19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[114 Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.[113 A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection it is faster and more sensitive.[97]',b'In late 2019 the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.[115]',b'The main pathological findings at autopsy are:[86]',b'Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home wearing a mask in public avoiding crowded places keeping distance from others ventilating indoor spaces washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds practising good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands.[119][120]',"b""Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider

emergency use authorization (EUA status by the US FDA and in several other countries.[124 Initially the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID-19 before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus outside the setting of a clinical trial.[125][126 Without a vaccine other prophylactic measures or effective treatments a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak known as ""flattening the curve"".[127 This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed

COVID\xe2\x80\x9119 pandemic there was established body of knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) which enabled accelerated development of various vaccine technologies during early 2020.[129 On 10 January 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID and by 19 March the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID-19.[130]',b'As of February 2021[update] 66 vaccine candidates are in clinical research including

(also known as physical distancing includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals Methods include quarantines travel restrictions and the closing of schools workplaces stadiums theatres or shopping centres Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home limiting travel avoiding crowded areas using no-contact greetings and physically distancing themselves from others.[139 Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[140]',b'Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.[141][142 In the United States the prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease and poor access to high-quality healthcare.[141]',b'Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.[143 Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.[144 Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.[citation needed]',b'The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.[145][146 This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.[146][147 Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking breathing and coughing.[146][147 A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air reducing the chances of infection.[148 But if the mask include an exhalation valve a wearer that is infected (maybe without having noticed that and asymptomatic would transmit the virus outwards through it despite any certification they can have So the masks with exhalation valve are not for the infected wearers and are not reliable to stop the pandemic in a large scale Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.[149]',b'Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[150 When not wearing a mask the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged Healthcare professionals interacting directly with people who have COVID-19 are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent in addition to other personal protective equipment.[151]',"b'Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required.[152 The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty before eating and after blowing one\'s nose.[153 The CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 alcohol but only when soap and water are not readily available.[152 For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available the WHO provides two formulations for local production In these formulations the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol it is ""not an active substance for hand

deposit the virus at the eyes nose or mouth where it can enter the body cause infection.[15 Current evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of Covid-19,[155 leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes.[156][157 Deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticized as hygiene theater giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air.[158][159]'",b'The amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface the temperature and the humidity.[160 Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight.[160 Like other enveloped viruses SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower and when the relative humidity is low (<50%).[160]',b'On many surfaces including as glass some types of plastic stainless steel and skin the virus can remain infective for several days indoors at room temperature or even about a week under ideal conditions.[160 On some surfaces including cotton fabric and copper the virus usually dies after a few hours.[160 As a general rule of thumb the virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces.[160

volume of testing healthcare system quality treatment options time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age sex and overall health.[241 The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the population of that demographic group Consequently the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well as the severity of the disease within a given population Mortality rates are highly correlated to age with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly.[242][243][244]',"b'The case fatality rate (CFR reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics the global death-to-case ratio is 2.2 (2,556,515/115,033,409 as of 3 March 2021.[6 The number varies by region.[245][246 The CFR may not reflect the true severity of the disease because some infected individuals remain asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms and hence such infections may not be included in official case reports Moreover the CFR may vary markedly over time and across locations due to the availability of live virus tests.'",b'Total confirmed cases over time',b'Total confirmed cases of COVID-19 per million people[247]',b'Total deaths over time',b'Total confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 per million

metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals hence in contrast to the CFR the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases.[252]',b'A recent (Dec 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5 to 1 in many locations (including France Netherlands New Zealand and Portugal) 1 to 2 in other locations (Australia England Lithuania and Spain) and exceeded 2 in Italy.[253 That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates in particular the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g. 0.002 at age 10 and 0.01 at age 25 but increases progressively to 0.4 at age 55 1.4 at age 65 4.6 at age 75 and 15 at age 85.[253 These results were also highlighted

reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.[270][271 One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.[272 Sex-based immunological differences lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.[273 In Europe 57 of the infected people were men and 72 of those died with COVID-19 were men.[274 As of April 2020 the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.[275 Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola HIV

equating to 30 January 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner John Derrick who gave witness

when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time ""krick""(-e) meaning a stick (crook).[11 Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word ""krickstoel"" meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[12 According to Heiner Gillmeister a European language expert of Bonn University ""cricket derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey met de (krik ket)sen (i.e. ""with the stick chase"").[13 Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.[13]'",b'Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects.[14 The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batsman defended a low two-stump wicket and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.[15][16][17]',"b""In 1611 the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance.[18 This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it

steps before bowling The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman who is forced to react very quickly.[84 Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing (i.e curve in flight This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot for example so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be ""caught behind by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder.[84 At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman A spinner will often ""buy his wicket by ""tossing one up (in a slower steeper parabolic path to lure the batsman

as they run) Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.[100]'","b'The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball\'s progress and this is communicated by calling usually ""yes"" ""no or ""wait"" More than one run can be scored from a single hit hits worth one to three runs are common but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.[100 To compensate for this hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary In these cases the batsmen do not need to run.[101 Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of ""overthrows by a fielder returning the ball If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker the two batsmen have changed ends and the one who was non-striker is now the striker

he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman\'s reach;[103 bye an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way;[104 leg bye as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman\'s body though not his bat.[104 If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide his team incurs an additional penalty

the modern game in certain key technical aspects the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects.[14 The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batsman defended a low two-stump wicket and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching

custodian the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC in London.[59]'",b'Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image right between two teams of eleven players each.[60 The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary which may be a fence part of the stands a rope a painted line or a combination of these the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.[61]',b'In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image below on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m apart.[62 The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m wide with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces notably matting) Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.[63]',b'As illustrated above the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines a bowling crease a popping crease and two return creases The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease which is eight feet eight inches long The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket) it is in fact unlimited in length The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease but is also in fact unlimited in length.[64]',"b'Before a match begins the team captains (who are also players toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings.[65 Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match.[65 In each innings one team bats attempting to score runs while the other team bowls and fields the ball attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen.[66][67 When the first innings ends the teams change roles there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day.[65 During an innings all eleven members of the fielding team take the field but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time The exception to this is if a batsman has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run in this case the batsman is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batsman hits a scoring run or runs,[68 though this does not apply in international cricket.[69 The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match but it can be varied.[60]'","b'The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but in some forms of cricket it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batsmen in their final innings in order to win the match which would otherwise be drawn.[70 If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents they are said to have ""lost by n runs (where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams) If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win it is said to have ""won by n wickets"" where n is the number of wickets left to fall For example a team that passes its opponents total having lost six wickets (i.e. six of their batsmen have been dismissed have won the match ""by four wickets"".[70]'","b'In a two-innings-a-side match one team\'s combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side\'s first innings total The team with the greater score is then said to have ""won by an innings and n runs"" and does not need to bat again n is the difference between the two teams aggregate scores If the team batting last is all out and both sides have scored the same number of runs then the match is a tie this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening in first-class matches from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017 In the traditional form of the game if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win then the game is declared a draw.[70]'","b'If the match has only a single innings per side then a maximum number of overs applies to each innings Such a match is called a ""limited overs or ""one-day match and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost

its developers is often used to recalculate a new target score A one-day match can also be declared a ""no-result if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible for example wet weather.[70]'",b'In all forms of cricket the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to

terminates if the batting team is ""all out"" a term defined by the Laws ""at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available

ends while the batsmen do not A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs although a bowler can (and usually does bowl alternate overs from the same end for several overs which are termed a ""spell"" The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at ""square leg now

additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads arm pads rib protectors and shoulder pads The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to

deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable during the course of this deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match Players will therefore attempt to modify the ball\'s behaviour by modifying its physical properties Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball\'s swing through the air but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball scratching the surface or picking at the seam are illegal ball tampering.[79]'",b'During

to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers.[82]',"b'Most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler although some are all-rounders and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally The specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively If the captain wants a bowler to ""change ends"" another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate.[73]'","b'A bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a ""run-up and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run-up for the first delivery of that over the ball then being ""in play"".[73 Fast bowlers needing momentum take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman who is forced to react very quickly.[84 Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing (i.e curve in flight This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot for example so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be ""caught behind by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder.[84 At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman A spinner will often ""buy his wicket by ""tossing one up (in a slower steeper parabolic path to lure the batsman into making a poor shot The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often ""flighted or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be ""trapped into getting himself out.[85 In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman\'s concentration.[84]'","b'There are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed five relatively common and five extremely rare The common forms of dismissal are bowled,[86 caught,[87 leg before wicket (lbw),[88 run out[89 and stumped.[90 Rare methods are hit wicket,[91 hit the ball twice,[92 obstructing the field,[93 handled the ball[94 and timed out.[95 The Laws state that the fielding team usually the bowler in practice must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision If the batsman is out the umpire raises a forefinger and says ""Out!"" otherwise he will shake his head and say ""Not out"".[96 There is effectively an eleventh method of dismissal retired out which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.[97]'","b'Batsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team.[60 Substitute batsmen are generally not allowed,[81 except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.[69]'",b'In order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance Standardly this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket looking in the direction of the bowler and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.[98]',"b'A skilled batsman can use a wide array of ""shots or ""strokes in both defensive and attacking mode The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat\'s blade If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an ""edge"" The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper Equally he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply ""blocking the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run A wide variety of shots are played the batsman\'s repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed e.g. ""cut"" ""drive"" ""hook"" ""pull"".[99]'","b'The batsman on strike (i.e the ""striker"" must prevent the ball hitting the wicket and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball To register a run both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run) Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.[100]'","b'The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball\'s progress and this is communicated by calling usually ""yes"" ""no or ""wait"" More than one run can be scored from a single hit hits worth one to three runs are common but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.[100 To compensate for this hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary In these cases the batsmen do not need to run.[101 Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of ""overthrows by a fielder returning the ball If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker the two batsmen have changed ends and the one who was non-striker is now the striker Only the striker can score individual runs but all runs are added to the team\'s total.[100]'","b'Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called ""sundries in Australia due to errors made by the fielding side This is achieved in four ways no-ball a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules;[102 wide a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman\'s reach;[103 bye an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way;[104 leg bye as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman\'s body though not his bat.[104 If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e. delivery has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball.[102][103]'","b'The captain is often the most experienced player in the team certainly the most tactically astute and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batsman a bowler or a wicket-keeper Within the Laws the captain has certain responsibilities in

Although there are claims for prior dates the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford on Monday 17 January 1597 (Julian calendar equating to 30 January 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner John Derrick who gave witness

when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time ""krick""(-e) meaning a stick (crook).[11 Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word ""krickstoel"" meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[12 According to Heiner Gillmeister a European language expert of Bonn University ""cricket derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey met de (krik ket)sen (i.e. ""with the stick chase"").[13 Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.[13]'",b'Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects.[14 The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batsman defended a low two-stump wicket and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.[15][16][17]',"b""In 1611 the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter

is the Middle Dutch word ""krickstoel"" meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[12 According to Heiner Gillmeister a European language expert of Bonn University ""cricket derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey met de (krik ket)sen (i.e. ""with the stick chase"").[13 Gillmeister has suggested

the modern game in certain key technical aspects the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects.[14 The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batsman defended a low two-stump wicket and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.[15][16][17]',"b""In 1611 the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter

run-up for the first delivery of that over the ball then being ""in play"".[73 Fast bowlers needing momentum take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman who is forced to react very quickly.[84 Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing (i.e curve in flight This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot for example so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be ""caught behind by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder.[84 At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman A spinner will often ""buy his wicket by ""tossing one up (in a slower steeper parabolic path to lure the batsman

credited.[97]'","b'Batsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team.[60 Substitute batsmen are generally not allowed,[81 except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.[69]'",b'In order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance Standardly this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket looking in the direction of the bowler and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.[98]',"b'A skilled batsman can use a wide array of ""shots or ""strokes in both defensive and attacking mode The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat\'s blade If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an ""edge"" The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper Equally he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply ""blocking the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run A wide

strike (i.e the ""striker"" must prevent the ball hitting the wicket and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball To register a run both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run) Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.[100]'","b'The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball\'s progress and this is communicated by calling usually ""yes"" ""no or ""wait"" More than one run can be scored from a single hit hits worth one to three runs are common but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.[100 To compensate for this hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary In these cases the batsmen do not need to run.[101 Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of ""overthrows by a fielder returning the ball If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker the two batsmen have changed ends and the one who was non-striker is now the striker Only the striker can score individual runs but all runs are added to the team\'s total.[100]'","b'Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called ""sundries in Australia due to errors made by the fielding side This is achieved in four ways no-ball a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules;[102 wide a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman\'s reach;[103 bye an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way;[104 leg bye as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman\'s body though not his bat.[104 If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e. delivery has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball.[102][103]'","b'The captain is often the most experienced

via contaminated surfaces although this is not thought to be the main route of transmission.[17 The exact route of transmission is rarely proven conclusively,[18 but infection mainly happens when people are near each other for long enough People who are infected can transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they themselves show symptoms as can people who do not experience symptoms People remain infectious for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms in moderate cases and up to 20 days in severe cases.[19] Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) or by loop-mediated isothermal amplification from a nasopharyngeal swab.""",b'Preventive measures include physical or social distancing quarantining ventilation of indoor spaces covering coughs and sneezes

locations[42 such as restaurants choirs gyms nightclubs offices and religious venues often when they are crowded or less ventilated.[41 It also occurs in healthcare settings often when aerosol-generating medical procedures are performed on COVID-19 patients.[43]',b'Although it is considered possible there is no direct evidence of the virus being transmitted by skin to skin

(windpipe and lungs).[64 The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[65 The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a ""spike (peplomer to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.[66 The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,[67 though another view is that increasing ACE2 using angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective.[68 As the alveolar disease progresses respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.[69]'",b'Whether SARS-CoV-2 is able to invade the nervous system remains unknown The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 people with neurological issues However SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID-19 but these results need to be confirmed.[70 SARS-CoV-2 could cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the CNS While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[71][72][73 The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS possibly within an infected white blood cell.[70]',b'The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric duodenal and rectal epithelium[74 as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[75]',"b'The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[76 An acute cardiac injury was found in 12 of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan China,[77 and is more frequent in severe disease.[78 Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[76 ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.[76][79 A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found people transferred to Intensive care unit (ICU with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.[80 Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots are thought to play a significant role in mortality incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.[81 Furthermore microvascular blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brains without detected SARS-CoV-2 and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID-19.[82][83][84]'",b'Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[81 Early reports show that up to 30 of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[85]',b'Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.[86]',b'Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract people with severe COVID-19 have

monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) macrophage inflammatory protein 1- (MIP-1\xce\xb1) and tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-\xce\xb1 indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS suggest an underlying immunopathology.[77]',b'Additionally people with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS have classical serum biomarkers of CRS including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) D-dimer and ferritin.[87]',b'Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart In particular pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID-19 .[88 Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.[86]',b'Multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus The S-protein otherwise known as the spike protein is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors It includes two subunits S1 and S2 S1 determines the virus host range and cellular tropism via the receptor binding domain S2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H1 and HR2 which are heptad repeat regions Studies have shown that S1 domain induced IgG and IgA antibody levels at a much higher capacity It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID-19 vaccines.[89]',"b""The M protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of

ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID-19 though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB However no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes Until further data is available guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain.[91]',b'The virus effect on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration increased blood vessel permeability alveolar wall permeability as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms However the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.[92]',b'The severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm.[93 Levels of interleukin 1B interferon-gamma interferon-inducible protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease.[94]',b'A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID-19 it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality The storm causes the acute respiratory distress syndrome blood clotting events such as strokes myocardial infarction encephalitis acute kidney injury and vasculitis The production of IL-1 IL-2 IL-6 TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma all crucial components of normal immune responses inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm The cells of the central nervous system the microglia neurons and astrocytes are also be involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon.[95]',b'COVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.[96][97 Along with laboratory testing chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.[98 Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection.[96]',"b'The standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests,[96][99 which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[100 As these

in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[26] By 1200 BCE an archaic form of Sanskrit an Indo-European language had diffused into India from the northwest unfolding as the language of the Rigveda and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[27] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[28] By 400 BCE stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[29] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[30] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[31] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[32 but also marked by the declining status of women,[33 and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][34 In South India the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[35]'","b""In the early medieval era Christianity Islam Judaism and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's southern and western coasts.[36] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[37] eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[38] In the 15th century the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[39] In the Punjab Sikhism emerged rejecting institutionalised religion.[40] The Mughal Empire in 1526 ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[41] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][42] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed turning India into a colonial economy but also consolidating its sovereignty.[43 British Crown rule began in 1858 The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[44 but technological changes were introduced and ideas of education modernity and the public life took root.[45] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[46 In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a

evidence for domestication of food crops and animals construction of permanent structures and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan

scriptures associated with Hinduism,[78 were composed during this period,[79 and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[77 Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[78 The caste system which created a hierarchy of priests warriors and free peasants but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure arose during this period.[80 On the Deccan Plateau archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[77 In South India a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[81 as well as by nearby traces of agriculture irrigation tanks and craft traditions.[81]'","b""In the late Vedic period around the 6th century BCE the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[82][83 The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements two of which became independent religions Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar Mahavira.[84 Buddhism based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[85][86][87 In an age of increasing urban wealth both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[88 and both established long-lasting monastic traditions Politically by the 3rd century BCE the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[89 The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[90][91 The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[92][93]""",b'The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that between 200 BCE and 200 CE the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras the Cholas and the Pandyas dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia.[94][95 In North India Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family leading to increased subordination of women.[96][89 By the 4th and 5th centuries the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[97][98 Under the Guptas a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself.[99 This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture which found patrons among an urban elite.[98 Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well and Indian science astronomy medicine and mathematics made significant advances.[98]',b'The Indian early medieval age 600 CE to 1200 CE is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[100 When Harsha of Kannauj who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE attempted to expand southwards he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[101 When his successor attempted to expand eastwards he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[101 When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[101 No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region.[100 During this time pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[102 The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[102]',b'In the 6th and 7th centuries the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[103 They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[103 Indian royalty big and small and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities which became economic hubs as well.[104 Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[104 By the 8th and 9th centuries the effects were felt in South-East Asia as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar Thailand Laos Cambodia Vietnam Philippines Malaysia and Java.[105 Indian merchants scholars and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission South-East Asians took the initiative as well with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[105]',"b""After the 10th century Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[106 The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[107][108 By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers learned men mystics traders artists and artisans from that region into the subcontinent thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[109][110 The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[111 Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[112 and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[111]""","b""In the early 16th century northern India then under mainly Muslim rulers,[113 fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[114 The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule Instead it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[115][116 and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[117 leading to more systematic centralised and uniform rule.[118 Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity especially under Akbar the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty expressed through a Persianised culture to an emperor who had near-divine status.[117 The Mughal state's economic policies deriving most revenues from agriculture[119 and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[120 caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[118 The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[118 resulting in greater patronage of painting literary forms textiles and architecture.[121 Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India such as the Marathas the Rajputs and the Sikhs gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule which through collaboration or adversity gave them both recognition and military experience.[122 Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[122 As the empire disintegrated many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[123]""","b""By the early 18th century with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred a number of European trading companies including the English East India Company had established coastal outposts.[124][125 The East India Company's control of the seas greater resources and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[126][124][127][128 Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[129 India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[124 By this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas like education social reform and culture.[130]""","b""Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885 The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty the surveillance of the population and the education of citizens Technological changes\xe2\x80\x94among them railways canals and the telegraph\xe2\x80\x94were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[131][132][133][134 However disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857 Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions including invasive British-style social reforms harsh land taxes and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[135][136 Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858 it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[137][138 In the decades following public life gradually emerged all over India leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[139][140][141][142]""","b'The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[143 There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[144 and despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[145 There were also salutary effects commercial cropping especially in the newly canalled Punjab led to increased food production for internal consumption.[146 The railway network provided critical famine relief,[147 notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[147 and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[146]'","b""After World War I in which approximately one million Indians served,[148 a new period began It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation by more strident Indian calls for self-rule and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[149 During the 1930s slow legislative reform was enacted by the British the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[150 The next decade was beset with crises Indian participation in World War II the Congress's final push for non-co-operation and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947 but tempered by the partition of India into two states India and Pakistan.[151]""","b""Vital to India's self-image

among a segment of India's Hindu population especially in southern India Gujarat and the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India as well as among Jains.[426 Among these groups strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat,[427 and contributes to the low proportional consumption of meat to overall diet in India.[427 Unlike China which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy rather than meat becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption

much earlier from India to Central and West Asia however it was during Mughal rule that dishes such as the pilaf,[424 developed in the interim during the Abbasid caliphate,[429 and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[430 To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia onions garlic almonds and spices began to be added in

through permission by elders.[55][needs update]',b'Gang rape and mass rape are often used as a means of male bonding This is particularly evident among soldiers as gang rape accounts for about three quarters or more of war rape while gang rape accounts for less than a quarter of rapes during peace time Commanders sometimes push recruits to rape as committing rape can be taboo and illegal and so builds loyalty among those involved Rebel groups who have forced recruitment as opposed to volunteer recruits are more involved in rape as it is believed the recruits start off with less loyalty to

does not involve the use of a condom in some cases a condom is used Use of a condom significantly reduces the likelihood of pregnancy and disease transmission both to the victim and to the rapist Rationales for condom use include avoiding contracting infections or diseases (particularly HIV) especially in cases of rape of sex workers or in gang rape (to avoid contracting infections or diseases from fellow rapists) eliminating evidence making prosecution more difficult (and giving a sense of invulnerability) giving the appearance of consent (in cases of acquaintance rape) and thrill from

II alveolar cells of the lungs.[65 The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a ""spike (peplomer to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.[66 The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,[67 though another view is that increasing ACE2 using angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective.[68 As the alveolar disease progresses respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.[69]'",b'Whether SARS-CoV-2 is able to invade the nervous system remains unknown The virus

results need to be confirmed.[70 SARS-CoV-2 could cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the CNS While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[71][72][73 The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS possibly within an infected white blood cell.[70]',b'The virus

intestine.[75]',"b'The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[76 An acute cardiac injury was found in 12 of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan China,[77 and is more frequent in severe disease.[78 Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[76 ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.[76][79 A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found people transferred to Intensive care unit (ICU with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.[80 Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots are thought to play a significant role in mortality incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.[81 Furthermore

further data is available guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain.[91]',b'The virus effect on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration increased blood vessel permeability alveolar wall permeability as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms However the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.[92]',b'The severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm.[93 Levels of interleukin 1B interferon-gamma interferon-inducible protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease.[94]',b'A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID-19 it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality The storm causes the acute respiratory distress syndrome blood clotting events such as strokes myocardial infarction encephalitis acute kidney injury and vasculitis The production of IL-1 IL-2 IL-6 TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma all crucial components of normal immune responses inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm The cells of the central nervous system the microglia neurons and astrocytes are also be involved in the

manufactured monoclonal antibodies are in development.[408]',b'The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID-19 is also being studied This involves the production of convalescent serum which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus which is then administered to current patients.[408 This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.[408 A Cochrane review in October 2020 found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against this treatment in COVID-19 due in large part to the methodology of the clinical trials conducted so far.[409 Specifically there are no trials yet conducted for which the safety of convalescent serum administration to people with COVID-19 can be

equating to 30 January 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner John Derrick who gave witness

Saxon a stick"".[6 In Old French the word ""criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.[11 Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time ""krick""(-e) meaning a stick (crook).[11 Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word ""krickstoel"" meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[12 According to Heiner Gillmeister a European language expert of Bonn University ""cricket derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey met de (krik ket)sen (i.e. ""with the stick chase"").[13 Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.[13]'",b'Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects.[14 The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batsman defended a low two-stump wicket and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.[15][16][17]',"b""In 1611 the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance.[18 This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it

again as directed by the captain or bowler.[75]',b'If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match a substitute is allowed to field instead of him but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.[69 The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.[81 The Laws of Cricket were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers.[82]',"b'Most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler although some are all-rounders and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally The specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively If the captain wants a bowler to ""change ends"" another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate.[73]'","b'A bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a ""run-up and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run-up for the first delivery of that over the ball then being ""in play"".[73 Fast bowlers needing momentum take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman who is forced to react very quickly.[84 Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing (i.e curve in flight This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot for example so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be ""caught behind by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder.[84 At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman A spinner will often ""buy his wicket by ""tossing one up (in a slower steeper parabolic path to lure the batsman into making a poor shot The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often ""flighted or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be ""trapped into getting himself out.[85 In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman\'s concentration.[84]'","b'There are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed five relatively common and five extremely rare The common forms of dismissal are bowled,[86 caught,[87 leg before wicket (lbw),[88 run out[89 and stumped.[90 Rare methods are hit wicket,[91 hit the ball twice,[92 obstructing the field,[93 handled the ball[94 and timed out.[95 The Laws state that the fielding team usually the bowler in practice must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision If the batsman is out the umpire raises a forefinger and says ""Out!"" otherwise he will shake his head and say ""Not out"".[96 There is effectively an eleventh method of dismissal retired out which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.[97]'","b'Batsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team.[60 Substitute batsmen are generally not allowed,[81 except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.[69]'",b'In order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance Standardly this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket looking in the direction of the bowler and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.[98]',"b'A skilled batsman can use a wide array of ""shots or ""strokes in both defensive and attacking mode The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat\'s blade If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an ""edge"" The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper Equally he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply ""blocking the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run A wide variety of shots are played the batsman\'s repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed e.g. ""cut"" ""drive"" ""hook"" ""pull"".[99]'","b'The batsman on strike (i.e the ""striker"" must prevent the ball hitting the wicket and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball To register a run both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run) Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.[100]'","b'The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball\'s progress and this is communicated by calling usually ""yes"" ""no or ""wait"" More than one run can be scored from a single hit hits worth one to three runs are common but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.[100 To compensate for this hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary In these cases the batsmen do not need to run.[101 Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of ""overthrows by a fielder returning the ball If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker the two batsmen have changed ends and the one who was non-striker is now the striker Only the striker can score individual runs but all runs are added to the team\'s total.[100]'","b'Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called ""sundries in Australia due to errors made by the fielding side This is achieved in four ways no-ball a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules;[102 wide a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman\'s reach;[103 bye an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way;[104 leg bye as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman\'s body though not his bat.[104 If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e. delivery has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball.[102][103]'","b'The captain is often the most experienced player in the team certainly the most tactically astute and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batsman a bowler or a wicket-keeper Within the Laws the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves ""within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws"".[60]'","b'The wicket-keeper (sometimes called simply the ""keeper"" is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about his equipment and demeanour He is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards.[105 Depending on their primary skills the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batsmen or specialist bowlers Generally a team will include five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers plus the wicket-keeper.[106][107]'","b'The game

Although there are claims for prior dates the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford on Monday 17 January 1597 (Julian calendar equating to 30 January 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner John Derrick who gave witness

a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c 1550 by boys in Surrey.[8 The view that it was originally a children\'s game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave\'s 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun ""crosse as ""the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket and the verb form ""crosser as ""to play at cricket"".[9][10]'","b'One possible source for the sport\'s name is the Old English word ""cryce (or ""cricc"" meaning a crutch or staff In Samuel Johnson\'s Dictionary he derived cricket from ""cryce Saxon a stick"".[6 In Old French the word ""criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.[11 Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time ""krick""(-e) meaning a stick (crook).[11 Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word ""krickstoel"" meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[12 According to Heiner Gillmeister a European language expert of Bonn University ""cricket derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey met de (krik ket)sen (i.e. ""with the stick chase"").[13 Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.[13]'",b'Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects.[14 The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batsman defended a low two-stump wicket and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.[15][16][17]',"b""In 1611 the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance.[18 This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it

in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[26] By 1200 BCE an archaic form of Sanskrit an Indo-European language had diffused into India from the northwest unfolding as the language of the Rigveda and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[27] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[28] By 400 BCE stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[29] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[30] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[31] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[32 but also marked by the declining status of women,[33 and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][34 In South India the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[35]'","b""In the early medieval era Christianity Islam Judaism and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's southern and western coasts.[36] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[37] eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[38] In the 15th century the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[39] In the Punjab Sikhism emerged rejecting institutionalised religion.[40] The Mughal Empire in 1526 ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[41] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][42] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed turning India into a colonial economy but also consolidating its sovereignty.[43 British Crown rule began in 1858 The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[44 but technological changes were introduced and ideas of education modernity and the public life took root.[45] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[46 In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[47][48]""","b""India has been a secular federal republic since 1950 governed in a democratic

evidence for domestication of food crops and animals construction of permanent structures and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan

wide-ranging trade.[75]'","b'During the period 2000\xe2\x80\x93500 BCE many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[77 The Vedas the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[78 were composed during this period,[79 and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[77 Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[78 The caste system which created a hierarchy of priests warriors and free peasants but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure arose during this period.[80 On the Deccan Plateau archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[77 In South India a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[81 as well as by nearby traces of agriculture irrigation tanks and craft traditions.[81]'","b""In the late Vedic period around the 6th century BCE the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[82][83 The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements two of which became independent religions Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar Mahavira.[84 Buddhism based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[85][86][87 In an age of increasing urban wealth both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[88 and both established long-lasting monastic traditions Politically by the 3rd century BCE the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[89 The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[90][91 The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[92][93]""",b'The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that between 200 BCE and 200 CE the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras the Cholas and the Pandyas dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia.[94][95 In North India Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family leading to increased subordination of women.[96][89 By the 4th and 5th centuries the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[97][98 Under the Guptas a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself.[99 This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture which found patrons among an urban elite.[98 Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well and Indian science astronomy medicine and mathematics made significant advances.[98]',b'The Indian early medieval age 600 CE to 1200 CE is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[100 When Harsha of Kannauj who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE attempted to expand southwards he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[101 When his successor attempted to expand eastwards he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[101 When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[101 No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region.[100 During this time pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[102 The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[102]',b'In the 6th and 7th centuries the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[103 They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[103 Indian royalty big and small and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities which became economic hubs as well.[104 Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[104 By the 8th and 9th centuries the effects were felt in South-East Asia as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar Thailand Laos Cambodia Vietnam Philippines Malaysia and Java.[105 Indian merchants scholars and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission South-East Asians took the initiative as well with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[105]',"b""After the 10th century Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[106 The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[107][108 By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers learned men mystics traders artists and artisans from that region into the subcontinent thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[109][110 The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[111 Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[112 and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[111]""","b""In the early 16th century northern India then under mainly Muslim rulers,[113 fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[114 The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule Instead it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[115][116 and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[117 leading to more systematic centralised and uniform rule.[118 Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity especially under Akbar the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty expressed through a Persianised culture to an emperor who had near-divine status.[117 The Mughal state's economic policies deriving most revenues from agriculture[119 and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[120 caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[118 The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[118 resulting in greater patronage of painting literary forms textiles and architecture.[121 Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India such as the Marathas the Rajputs and the Sikhs gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule which through collaboration or adversity gave them both recognition and military experience.[122 Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[122 As the empire disintegrated many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[123]""","b""By the early 18th century with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred a number of European trading companies including the English East India Company had established coastal outposts.[124][125 The East India Company's control of the seas greater resources and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[126][124][127][128 Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[129 India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[124 By this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas like education social reform and culture.[130]""","b""Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885 The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty the surveillance of the population and the education of citizens Technological changes\xe2\x80\x94among them railways canals and the telegraph\xe2\x80\x94were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[131][132][133][134 However disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857 Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions including invasive British-style social reforms harsh land taxes and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[135][136 Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858 it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[137][138 In the decades following public life gradually emerged all over India leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[139][140][141][142]""","b'The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[143 There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[144 and despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[145 There were also salutary effects commercial cropping especially in the newly canalled Punjab led to increased food production for internal consumption.[146 The railway network provided critical famine relief,[147 notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[147 and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[146]'","b""After World War I in which approximately one million Indians served,[148 a new period began It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation by more strident Indian calls for self-rule and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[149 During the 1930s slow legislative reform was enacted by the British the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[150 The next decade was beset with crises Indian participation in World War II the Congress's final push for non-co-operation and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947 but tempered by the partition of India into two states India and Pakistan.[151]""","b""Vital to India's self-image

spreading to its south-west and later south and south-east.[160 Simultaneously the vast Tethyan oceanic crust to its northeast began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[160 These dual processes driven by convection in the Earth's mantle both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[160 Immediately south

among a segment of India's Hindu population especially in southern India Gujarat and the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India as well as among Jains.[427 Among these groups strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat,[428 and contributes to the low proportional consumption of meat to overall diet in India.[428 Unlike China which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy rather than meat becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption accompanying higher economic growth.[429]""","b'In the last millennium the most significant import of cooking techniques into India occurred during the Mughal Empire The cultivation of rice had spread much earlier from India to Central and West Asia however it was during Mughal rule that dishes such as the pilaf,[424 developed in the interim during the Abbasid caliphate,[430 and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[431 To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia onions garlic almonds and spices began to be added in India.[431 Rice grown to the southwest of the Mughal capital Agra which had become famous in the Islamic world for its fine grain was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat the pot sealed tightly and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique to produce what has today become the Indian biryani,[431 a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[432] In food served in restaurants in urban north India and internationally the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine This was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab region who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India and had arrived in India as refugees.[427 The identification of Indian cuisine with

in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[26] By 1200 BCE an archaic form of Sanskrit an Indo-European language had diffused into India from the northwest unfolding as the language of the Rigveda and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[27] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[28] By 400 BCE stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[29] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[30] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[31] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[32 but also marked by the declining status of women,[33 and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][34 In South India the Middle kingdoms exported

evidence for domestication of food crops and animals construction of permanent structures and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan

wide-ranging trade.[75]'","b'During the period 2000\xe2\x80\x93500 BCE many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[77 The Vedas the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[78 were composed during this period,[79 and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[77 Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[78 The caste system which created a hierarchy of priests warriors and free peasants but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure arose during this period.[80 On the Deccan Plateau archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[77 In South India a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[81 as well as by nearby traces of agriculture irrigation tanks and craft traditions.[81]'","b""In the late Vedic period around the 6th century BCE the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[82][83 The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements two of which became independent religions Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar Mahavira.[84 Buddhism based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[85][86][87 In an age of increasing urban wealth both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[88 and both established long-lasting monastic traditions Politically by the 3rd century BCE the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[89 The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[90][91 The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[92][93]""",b'The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that between 200 BCE and 200 CE the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras the Cholas and the Pandyas dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia.[94][95 In North India Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family leading to increased subordination of women.[96][89 By the 4th and 5th centuries the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[97][98 Under the Guptas a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself.[99 This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture which found patrons among an urban elite.[98 Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well and Indian science astronomy medicine and mathematics made significant advances.[98]',b'The Indian early medieval age 600 CE to 1200 CE is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[100 When Harsha of Kannauj who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE attempted to expand southwards he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[101 When his successor attempted to expand eastwards he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[101 When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[101 No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region.[100 During this time pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[102 The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[102]',b'In the 6th and 7th centuries the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[103 They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[103 Indian royalty big and small and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities which became economic hubs as well.[104 Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[104 By the 8th and 9th centuries the effects were felt in South-East Asia as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar Thailand Laos Cambodia Vietnam Philippines Malaysia and Java.[105 Indian merchants scholars and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission South-East Asians took the initiative as well with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[105]',"b""After the 10th century Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[106 The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[107][108 By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers learned men mystics traders artists and artisans from that region into the subcontinent thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[109][110 The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[111 Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[112 and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[111]""","b""In the early 16th century northern India then under mainly Muslim rulers,[113 fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[114 The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule Instead it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[115][116 and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[117 leading to more systematic centralised and uniform rule.[118 Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity especially under Akbar the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty expressed through a Persianised culture to an emperor who had near-divine status.[117 The Mughal state's economic policies deriving most revenues from agriculture[119 and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[120 caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[118 The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[118 resulting in greater patronage of painting literary forms textiles and architecture.[121 Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India such as the Marathas the Rajputs and the Sikhs gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule which through collaboration or adversity gave them both recognition and military experience.[122 Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[122 As the empire disintegrated many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[123]""","b""By the early 18th century with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred a number of European trading companies including the English East India Company had established coastal outposts.[124][125 The East India Company's control of the seas greater resources and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[126][124][127][128 Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[129 India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[124 By this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas like education social reform and culture.[130]""","b""Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885 The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state These included the

telegraph\xe2\x80\x94were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[131][132][133][134 However disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857 Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions including invasive British-style social reforms harsh land taxes and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[135][136 Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858 it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[137][138 In the decades following public life gradually emerged all over India leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[139][140][141][142]""","b'The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[143 There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[144 and despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[145 There were also salutary effects commercial cropping especially in the newly canalled Punjab led to increased food production for internal consumption.[146 The railway network provided critical famine relief,[147 notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[147 and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[146]'","b""After World War I in which

Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[150 The next decade was beset with crises Indian participation in World War II the Congress's final push for non-co-operation and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947 but tempered by the partition of India into two states India and Pakistan.[151]""","b""Vital to India's self-image

worn around the head as a part of a tradition or to keep off the sun or the cold).[407]',b'Until the beginning of the first millennium CE the ordinary dress of people in India was entirely unstitched.[408 The arrival of the Kushans from Central Asia circa 48 CE popularised cut and sewn garments in the style of Central Asian favoured by the elite in northern India.[408 However it was not until Muslim rule was established first with the Delhi sultanate and then the Mughal Empire that the range of stitched clothes in India grew and their use became significantly more widespread.[408 Among the various garments gradually establishing themselves in northern India during medieval and early-modern times and now commonly worn are the shalwars and pyjamas both forms of trousers as well as the tunics kurta and kameez.[408 In southern India however the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[408]',"b""Shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom They are held up by a drawstring or elastic belt which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[409 The pants can be wide and baggy or they can be cut quite narrow on the bias in which case they are called churidars The kameez is a long shirt or tunic.[410 The side seams are left open below the waist-line,[411]) which gives the wearer greater freedom of movement The kameez is usually cut straight and flat older kameez use traditional cuts modern kameez are more likely to have European-inspired set-in sleeves The kameez may have a European-style collar a Mandarin-collar or it may be collarless in the latter case its design as a women's garment is similar to a kurta.[412 At first worn by Muslim women the use of shalwar kameez gradually spread making them a regional style,[413][414 especially in the Punjab region.[415] [416]""","b""A kurta which traces its roots to Central Asian nomadic tunics has evolved stylistically in India as a garment for everyday wear as well as for formal occasions.[408 It is traditionally made of cotton or silk it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration such as chikan and it can be loose or tight in the torso typically falling either just above or somewhere below the wearer's knees.[417 The sleeves of a traditional kurta fall to the wrist without narrowing the ends hemmed but not cuffed the kurta can be worn by both men and women it is traditionally collarless though standing collars are increasingly popular and it can be worn over ordinary pyjamas loose shalwars churidars or less traditionally over jeans.[417]""","b'In the last 50 years fashions have changed a great deal in India Increasingly in urban settings in northern India the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear transformed instead into one for formal occasions.[418 The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger women who favour churidars or jeans.[418 The kurtas worn by young men usually fall to the shins and are seldom plain In white-collar office settings ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[418 For weddings and formal occasions men in the middle and upper classes often wear bandgala or short Nehru jackets with pants with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[418 The dhoti the once universal garment of Hindu India the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven form of khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[419] is seldom seen in the cities,[418 reduced now with brocaded border to the liturgical vestments of Hindu priests.'","b""Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines Given the range of diversity in soil type climate culture ethnic groups and occupations these cuisines vary substantially from each other using locally available spices herbs vegetables and fruit Indian foodways have been influenced by religion in particular Hindu cultural choices and traditions.[420 They have been also shaped by Islamic rule particularly that of the Mughals by the arrival of the Portuguese on India's southwestern shores and by British rule These three influences are reflected respectively in the dishes of pilaf and biryani the vindaloo and the tiffin and the Railway mutton curry.[421 Earlier the Columbian exchange had brought the potato the tomato maize peanuts cashew nuts pineapples guavas and most notably chilli peppers to India Each became staples of use.[422 In turn the spice trade between India and Europe was a catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.[423]""","b""The cereals grown in India their choice times and regions of planting correspond strongly to the timing of India's monsoons and the variation across regions in their associated rainfall.[424 In general the broad division of cereal zones in India as determined by their dependence on rain was firmly in place before the arrival of artificial irrigation.[424 Rice which requires a lot of water has been grown traditionally in regions of high rainfall in the northeast and the western coast wheat in regions of moderate rainfall like India's northern plains and millet in regions of low rainfall such as on the Deccan Plateau and in Rajasthan.[425][424]""",b'The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[426 The latter includes lentils pulses and vegetables spiced commonly with ginger and garlic but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include coriander cumin turmeric cinnamon cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[426 In an actual meal this mental representation takes the form of a platter or thali with a central place for the cooked cereal peripheral ones often in small bowls for the flavourful accompaniments and the simultaneous rather than piecemeal ingestion of the two in each act of eating whether by actual mixing\xe2\x80\x94for example of rice and lentils\xe2\x80\x94or in the folding of one\xe2\x80\x94such as bread\xe2\x80\x94around the other such as cooked vegetables.[426]',"b""A notable feature of Indian food is the existence of a number of distinctive vegetarian cuisines each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[428 The appearance of ahimsa or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history especially Upanishadic Hinduism Buddhism and Jainism is thought to have been a notable factor in the prevalence of vegetarianism among a segment of India's Hindu population especially in southern India Gujarat and the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India as well as among Jains.[428 Among these groups strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat,[429 and contributes to the low proportional consumption of meat to overall diet in India.[429 Unlike China which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy rather than meat becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption accompanying higher economic growth.[430]""","b'In the last millennium the most significant import of cooking techniques into India occurred during the Mughal Empire The cultivation of rice had spread much earlier from India to Central and West Asia however it was during Mughal rule that dishes such as the pilaf,[425 developed in the interim during the Abbasid caliphate,[431 and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[432 To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia onions garlic almonds and spices began to be added in India.[432 Rice grown to the southwest of the Mughal capital Agra which had become famous in the Islamic world for its fine grain was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat the pot sealed tightly and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique to produce what has today become the Indian biryani,[432 a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[433] In food served in restaurants in urban north India and internationally the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine This was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab region who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India and had arrived in India as refugees.[428 The identification of Indian cuisine with the tandoori chicken\xe2\x80\x94cooked in the tandoor oven which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region especially among Muslims but which is originally from Central Asia\xe2\x80\x94dates to this period.[428]'",b'Cricket is the most popular sport in India.[434 Major domestic competitions include the Indian Premier League which is the most-watched
